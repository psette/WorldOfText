/* NOTES
FactoryManager keeps track of the FactorySimulation and the rate of animation on the RenderPanel
- the FactorySimulation is updated at the rate that is set by the JSlider in the FactoryClientGUI.
- after the data is updated, the FactoryPanel will render the data from the Simulation
- a single thread manages the rate of animation, called animator
